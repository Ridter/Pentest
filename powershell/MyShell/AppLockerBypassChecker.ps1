# AppLocker Bypass Checker (Default Rules) v1.0
#
# One of the Default Rules in AppLocker allows everything in the folder C:\Windows to be executed.
# A normal user shouln't have write permission in that folder, but that is not always the case.
# This script tries to copy an executable to every folder in Windows and (if the copy succeeds)
# it will try to execute it.
